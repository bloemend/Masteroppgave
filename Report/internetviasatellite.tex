If there is a satellite dish available, getting Internet is fairly easy. Satellite internet does not use telephone lines or cable systems, but instead utilizes a  satellite dish to get two-way data communication. Satellite Internet consists of a satellite dish, a modem (both for uplink and downlink), a coaxial cable between the dish and the modem, and an Ethernet cable from the modem to the laptop. 

Make sure that the cables are connected correctly. That the coaxial cable are connected from the satellite to the modem, and that the PC is connected to the modem via an Ethernet cable.

The rest of the set-up is identical to the one used to get cabeled Internet from a wall jack described in Section \ref{subsec:cabledInternet}. 

%Locate the coaxial cable that comes from the dish. After the modem is installed, you plug the coaxial cable to "SATELLITE IN" and "SATELLITE OUT" ports on the modem. Then plug the Ethernet cable to the modem and to your computer. 

%So, basically after this is set-up, you can follow the description of how to get Internet to the MP via a PC to get Internet from satellite to the mesh network.
