Women are in general in a more vulnerable position when living in a  camp, especially if they are single mothers. They may be solely responsible for taking care of the children in addition to sick and elderly family members, maintaining the household, preparing food, acquire water, and securing firewood. Collecting firewood for cooking is a necessity, but it forces women  to walk far away, hence making them vulnerable for sexual assault. they have to turn to sex and other unhealthy and dangerous means in order to survive. \cite{womenRefugee} 


The means of communication vary greatly in the different camps. Some have internet connection and satellite TV, other barely have access to a radio. even though radios are the most common media for communication, it is not given that all citizens in a camp has access to one. Often people would gather around the few radios that exists in a camp. One issue is that limits the usage is the batteries. They are very expensive and hard to acquire. The women were interested in news regarding their place of origin.   \cite{womenRefugee}
