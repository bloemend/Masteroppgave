\section{Dadaab Refugee Camp}
%Når ble den oppretta?
Dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world, and is located in Daadaab, Kenya \cite{dadaab}. There are as many as 500,000 registered refugees in this camp. The lead agency for this camp is the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). In addition to UNHCR, major international humanitarian agencies like Care, Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee  are active helpers in the Dadaab refugee camp. These agencies provide the refugees with critical services (e.g. food, housing, sanitation and medical help). This is an extremely challenging task in refugee camps, especially when they reach this size. 

\paragraph{Al Shabaab}
Al Shabaad is a Somali-based terrorist group. Al Shabaab started doing miscellaneous misdeeds both in the Dadaab refugee camp, and around the camp.
