\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conclusion} 

Internet is considered a human right. However, two thirds of the world's population are without Internet connection. With the arising climate changes, natural disasters are becoming a more common phenomenon. When these disasters occur, existing communication systems often break down, or can not be utilized due to power outages. The above conditions lead to the need of a mobile communication system. We wanted to create a solution that could be utilized in many different scenarios, and by different people. This includes everything from small and large relief organizations to "average Joe". An important factor is that the system has to be affordable and easy to use. Our solutions builds on Keith Williamson's concept, the "go box". We have taken his solution to the next level, utilizing the second generation Mesh Potato, as well as including everything necessary for a quick set-up anywhere in the world, and in any situation. Hence, we named our solution the \gls{quick} box. 

QUICK stands for Quick User-friendly Internet-providing Communication Kit. The Q stands for Quick, because it is easy to set-up. We made manuals for all the different set-ups necessary to get started with the box and to provide Internet to the network. We have also automated some of the set-up processes by making a script. The U stands for User-friendly. The manuals we have made have been tested on both technical and non-technical persons, in order to make them easy to understand and as user-friendly as possible. I stands for Internet-providing. The focus during our research has been on providing Internet to the network of Mesh Potatoes. The manuals we have made guides the user through how to get Internet to the MP by using different types of up-links, depending on the up-link available. C stand for Communication. In today's society, and especially during emergency situations, it is crucial to have the possibility to communicate, both within a community, and with the outside world. K stand for Kit, since this solution is delivered in a mobile suitcase ready to go in any situation. The \gls{quick} box includes a pre-configured Mesh Potato version 2, a battery to provide the MP with power, a solar panel to charge the battery, a charging regulator, necessary cables, a CD with Linux Ubuntu, a USB-stick containing the script and the different set-up manuals. 
This results in a kit that can act as a stand-alone solution. This solution can be utilized in different scenarios covering everything from emergency situations and natural disasters, to festivals and temporary refugee camps.

In the process of setting up the Mesh Potatoes, various configurations and installations were conducted. Since Village Telco is a company based on voluntary work, the descriptions found on the wiki have been partially added along the way resulting in a extensive, but little user-friendly and confusing page. We found these explanations difficult to use, and spent a lot of time interpreting them. A big part of our work has therefore been to simplify these descriptions, and assemble them in one place. We want the descriptions to be universal, meaning that everyone, including non-technical people, can run through them. These set-ups are therefore "dumbed down". We looked at different types of up-links, and created manuals for connecting the MP to each of them. 

Ever since Village Telco was founded in 2008, both Village Telco's devices (MPs) and mesh networking in general have been under constant development. It is clear that Village Telco has a burning passion for providing affordable communication in rural areas. A lot of new research has been conducted in this field in a short period of time. There is no doubt that mesh networking is an up-and-coming technology. This is supported by Apple's introduction of the Connectivity framework. Without hesitation, we can conclude that mesh networking is a technology we will see more and more of in the near future.  

\section{Future Work}
The research presented in this paper has only touched the surface of the Mesh Potato's potential. There are a great many aspects that need to be taken into consideration for further work in this area. The results we have presented in this paper can lay the basis for improvements of the \gls{quick} box. One possibility is to conduct a more detailed and extensive testing of the \gls{quick} box, including testing in realistic scenarios. One possibility for future work could be to make automated scripts for connecting to each up-link type. Each up-link type could have their own USB-stick. When Internet connection is desirable, the user could then just plug in the corresponding USB-stick, and the rest of the set-up would go automatically. This emphasizes Village Telco's vision of a plug-and-play solution. Another future possibility for the Mesh Potato, is to enable the possibility to communicate with other commercial mesh networks, for example Apple's. The possibilities are as good as infinite, since this is a complex and a very hot topic.
