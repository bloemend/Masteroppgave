This study was carried out as a Master's thesis on behalf of the \gls{item} at the \gls{ntnu}, in cooperation with Village Telco. This report is the final result of our Master's thesis and is worth 30 ECTS points. The study was conducted between January and June 2014. The project description was outlined in cooperation with our supervisor Sjur Eivind Usken from Aarbakke Innovation AS.

We would like to thank Sjur Eivind Usken who has guided us throughout this period, and contributed with helpful ideas, feedback and support. We would also like to thank our professor Norvald Stol for his feedback and support. We would also like to thank the Village Telco community, especially Steve Song and Keith Williamson, for taking the time to answer our questions and for helping us along the way. Also a thanks to Marte Berg Innset for the collaboration on the background chapter. Finally, we would like to thank everyone who helped us test the prototype of the QUICK box. \\
