Essentially the discussion chapter tells your reader what your findings might mean, how valuable they are and why. I remember struggling with this section myself and, looking back, I believe there were two sources of anxiety

How has the field's knowledge been changed?

Village Telco provides people with an extensive and comprehensive Wiki page. Unfortunately this page is not very well structured and can be apprehended as confusing, as well as little user friendly. In addition to this, the majority of the descriptions provided on the Wiki are directed towards the Mesh Potato v1.0. We started our research by setting up a network existing of the first generation Mesh Potato, and then moved on to the second generation. The second generation are improved on many areas, making the MP2.0 both faster and easier to use. Hence the descriptions are outdated and too complicated. A lot of the descriptions for MP1.0 requires the use of shell commands, while with MP2.0 more configurations can be done using the web interface. Shell commands are not well known to "average Joe", and leaves rooms for many mistakes. It may be hard to undo actions conducted using shell commands, especially if you do not have any knowledge about it.
