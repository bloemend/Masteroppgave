\label{chp:appendixA} 

This appendix contains the summary from the interview conducted on Mary Muia (CARE International in Kenya | Program Assistant
Refugee Assistance Programme | Dadaab).


\begin{enumerate}

\item Approximately how many people are there in the Dadaab refugee camp? And how long have it been in operation?

The Dadaab complex of refugee camps, considered the worldâ€™s largest, was created in 1991 by the Government of Kenya and UNHCR to host Somali refugees displaced by civil war. Over the years, the camps have also hosted other nationalities from the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes and East Africa regions but they constitute less than two percent of the camp population. The original camps were Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera and were intended to host 90,000 refugees. However, in 2011, there was an influx of new refugees from Somalia due to severe drought and new camps were created; Ifo 2 and Kambioos, to cater to the over 175,000 new arrivals and at the peak of the influx in 2011, the camps hosted more than 463,000 refugees, including some 10,000 third-generation refugees born in Dadaab to refugee parents who were also born there. However, in 2013, UNHCR and its partners conducted a verification exercise to ascertain the current population since some of those who had arrived in 2011 due to the famine had returned home. As at February, 2014, the current population stands at 369,294.

\item How do you connect and communicate with the outside world?

CARE as an organization has invested in communication systems in liaison with Internet Service Providers in the capital city of Nairobi who ensure that all staff have access to internet for both official and social usage.

\item How are the communication inside the camp (communication flow)?

Several telecommunication firms in Kenya have put up their machinery in the area thus there is access to both mobile communication and access to internet services. There are also radio station services and access to digital televisions. CARE uses telephone services to reach out to refugee staff (50\%) of the refugees have access to mobile phone services - either owned or through a bureau) posters and radio to reach out to its beneficiary population. In addition, there is word of mouth done through loud speakers during major gatherings like food distribution days and also road shows within the camps.


\item How does the refugees receive information?

As 3 above.

\item Can you exlain what happens when a new person enters the camp?

Upon arrival, a new refugee would report to a UNHCR reception desk whereby they are given temporary registration pending full registration and location of their relatives is they have any already in the camp. UNHCR fully briefs the new arrival on all the services available and which Agency is handling what service. Immunizations, medical attention, emergency food supply, tarpaulins, sleeping mats, jerrycans for fetching water and kitchen sets are issued to such new arrivals to help them start their new lives in the camps. UNHCR then hands over the new arrivals to the respective Agency doing camp management in the specific camp they are allocated so that they can be shown where to pitch their tents. The camps are well demarcated into numbered sections and blocks thus at any given time, UNHCR would inform you where a particular refugee resides and the family size. Each Agency working in Dadaab has their own mode of communicating the services they provide to their target beneficiaries. However, UNHCR holds regular meetings with the refugee leaders of each respective camp whereby information is shared with them for dissemination to the entire refugee population.


\item What are the biggest challenges in a refugee camp?

Lack of enough space to accommodate everyone and lack of enough funds to take care of all the needs of the refugees.


\item What is the biggest challenge when it comes to communication/information spreading in the refugee camp?

Language barrier between the humanitarian staff and the refugees since many of the staff do not speak/understand the Somali language while 95.6\% of the refugees are Somali. Internet and telephone service outages are also common in the area and response by the service providers sometime take a while.


\item What means of communication do you use in the refugee camp?

Mobile phones and computers for both telephone and internet access. Radios and television services.

N/A since I am not a technical person
