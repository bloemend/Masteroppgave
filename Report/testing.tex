\chapter{Testing the QUICK Box}
\label{chp:test} 

In order to assurance the quality of the manuals and the \gls{quick} box, we conducted a test iteration. Testing is an important part in the iteration when developing a product. Using test persons with different technical background and knowledge, as well as different gender and age, will give us valuable output and comments that we in advance did not foresee.
