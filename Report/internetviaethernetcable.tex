\subsubsection{Quickly Connect a MP01 to the Internet via Ethernet Cable}

These instructions requires that the MP01 is new or factory reset, so that no former configurations will affect the following set-up. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure that the Mesh Potato is connected to a PC running Linux with an Ethernet cable. 
\item The default IP address of the MPs are 10.130.1.20, so in order to access the MP, the PC must be on the same subnet. To do this write in the terminal: 
\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ ifconfig eth0 up 10.130.1.120 netmask 255.255.255.0
\end{lstlisting}
\item Enter the SECN web interface by typing the IP address (10.130.1.20) of the MP01 in a browser. 
\item Change the IP address under "Network" to 192.168.1.x (Where x is a number between 21 and 99. If it is the first MP that is set-up it is normal to choose 21). Press "Save and Reboot" in the interface. Wait for the MP to reboot. 
\item Open Linux terminal and type in the following command: 
\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ sudo su
  $ ifconfig eth0 172.31.255.253 netmask 255.255.255.252 
\end{lstlisting}
\item Telnet into the MP01:
\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ telnet 172.31.255.254 
\end{lstlisting}
You have now entered the root environment of the MP01. 
\item Execute udhcpc: 
*Skrive hva denne kommandoen gjør
\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ udhcpc -i eth0 
\end{lstlisting}
You will get a message stating that the udhcpc process has started. This is followed by several messages stating "Sending discover...". When this appears unplug the Ethernet cable connected to the PC, and connect it with an Ethernet cable to cabled Internet (wall).

\item Internet will now be available for the mesh network. The SSID and password for the network can be found and altered in the interface. 
\end{enumerate}
