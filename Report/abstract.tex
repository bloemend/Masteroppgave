Village Telco is an organization that aims to provide affordable communication in forms of data and voice services where no other companies can, or are willing to do so. Village Telco provides a “plug-and-play” solution with low cost voice and data service. While designed for the developing world, Village Telco’s solution can be applied anywhere where people wish to take control of their own telephone infrastructure.

This solution is delivered using an inexpensive fixed mesh WiFi delivery system called the Mesh Potato. The Mesh Potato unit is based on the open-source operating system, OpenWRT. Open Source telephony software combined with the latest wireless networking technology creates the potential for people to operate their own community phone systems. Mesh Potato networks have no dependence on existing telecom infrastructure, and can relatively easily be deployed anywhere in the world. It can either be deployed as a stand-alone solution or as an extension to existing technologies. Village Telco’s solution has been deployed in several countries around the world: from East-Timor and Nepal in Asia to several African and South America countries. The installed bases vary from 10 to several hundreds of Mesh Potatoes.
