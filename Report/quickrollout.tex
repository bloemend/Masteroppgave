\section{Up-Link}
In 2011, UN declared Internet access a Human Right \cite{HR}. This says something about the extent of the Internet, and the importance of connectivity. 
To provide Internet to the mesh network formed by the Mesh Potatoes, at least on of the MPs must be connected to an access network via an uplink. An uplink connects a device or a LAN to a larger network \cite{uplink}. There are several ways of connecting to the Internet. In the following sections, we will look at some of the uplinks available, and how Internet access can be provided.

\subsection{Landline}
The most common way of getting Internet access is via a landline. This is usually in the form of twisted pairs (copper lines). These lines support broadband up to 10 Mbps, and are often in form of ADSL, or other digital subscriber line of type x (xDSL) technologies \citep{audestad}.

\subsection{Satellite}

Internet from satellites are offered by a satellite Internet provider \cite{cablevssatellite}. The satellite are orbiting the Earth, and get signals from a land based Internet connection. To get Internet access via satellite you need a satellite dish. The main advantage of using satellite is that it provides an universally available Internet access \cite{broadband}. Since it is universally available, it is fitted for use in rural regions where there exists no landlines or other options for connecting to the Internet. But like with everything else, there also exists disadvantages with using satellite-Internet. Since it is a shared medium, privacy concerns arise, and the speed are dependent of simultaneous use. Another disadvantage is that the connection can be affected by bad weather, unlike for a wired connection.

\section{Different Scenarios Where a Quick Roll-out is Necessary}
%What are the specific need for the different scenarios? What adjustments are necessary?

Everyday there are situations all over the world that in some way affects the modern communications systems, or causes a need for one. These situations can range in everything from big natural disasters like the tsunami in Japan or the volcano outbreak in the Philippines, where either parts of the communication system is not functioning or there is a desperate need for one. To temporary refugee camps and IDP camps, and situations where a mobile tower is down, or blackouts. Also more festive situations can have use of the quick roll-out system. Imagine a big group gathered at a festival in another country. It is expensive to call or use mobile data, to be able to use cheap internet via the mesh Potatoes would save the users for a lot of money. 

\subsection{Natural Disasters}

A Natural disaster id defines as; \textit{any event or force of nature that has catastrophic consequences, such as avalanche, earthquake, flood, forest fire, hurricane, lightning, tornado, tsunami, and volcanic eruption} \cite{naturalDisaster}.


\subsection{Blackouts}

\subsection{Temporary Refugee and IDP camps}
Not all refugee and IDP camps are as well established, like the ones in Dadaab. Many camps are temporary, and are therefore in more need of a temporary communication system. 

\subsection{Breakdown of Mobile Towers}


The 10th of June 2011 one of Telenor had problems with one of its servers in Oslo. This problem caused a down time of 18 hours and affected 3 000 000 Telenor users \cite{listeNedetid}. Not only was this the biggest problem Telenor have had since they opened their mobile network in 1993, but also the longest downtime and highest number of affected users recorded in Norway. In addition to this it all happened in a period with severe flooding in big parts of the eastern Norway, and made it difficult to reach emergency numbers. The fact that the problems occurred during the flooding just made the situation much worse. \cite{TelenorNede}
