\section{Up-Link}
In 2011, UN declared Internet access a Human Right \cite{HR}. This says something about the extent of the Internet, and the importance of connectivity. 
To provide Internet to the mesh network formed by the Mesh Potatoes, an uplink is necessary. An uplink connects a device or a LAN to a larger network \cite{uplink}. There are several ways of connecting to the Internet. In the following sections, we will look at some of the uplinks available, and how Internet access can be provided.

\subsection{Landline}
The most common way of getting Internet access is via a landline.

\subsubsection{Internet Service Provider}

\subsection{Mobile Network}
\subsubsection{UMTS - 3G}
\subsubsection{WiMax - 4G}

\subsection{Satellite}
Internet from satellites are offered by a satellite Internet provider \cite{cablevssatellite}. The satellite are orbiting the Earth, and get signals from a land based Internet connection. To get Internet access via satellite you need a satellite dish. The main advantage of using satellite is that it provides an universally available Internet access \cite{broadband}. Since it is universally available, it is fitted for use in rural regions where there exists no landlines or other options for connecting to the Internet. But like with everything else, there also exists disadvantages with using satellite-Internet. Since it is a shared medium, privacy concerns arise, and the speed are dependent of simultaneous use. Another disadvantage is that the connection can be affected by bad weather, unlike for a wired connection.
